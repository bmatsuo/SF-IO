Story:
IO-net was a project to create a free network for everybody do share ideas and knowledge. 
It worked quite good until a group of scientists which was close to figure out a new source of free energy started to share information about it.
As soon as the governement heard about that, they started to be really annoying because they were scary to loose there power.
They put all important scientists and freedom activists in prison, they turned off the IO-net and destroyed all the copies of the IO-net sofware.
They don't want us to be free and they are trying to control everything.
I think they want to figure out this new free energy and sell it to us later on.

The situation is really difficult because all the important people with information were cought by the governement and nobody out there knows where are all the IO-net computers.

If somebody could reactivate all the IO-net computers it would be possible to figure out the new free energy before the governement. So we could stop them and build our own free and open-minded world!
